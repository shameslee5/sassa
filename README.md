If your [Ssassa status check approved but no payment](https://srd-sassa-gov.co.za/sassa-r350-grant-status-approved-but-no-payment-date/) has been received, it could be due to delays in processing or issues with your payment details. Ensure your bank information is correct and updated on the SASSA portal. Payments are often made in batches, so check your payment date on the status portal or contact SASSA directly for clarification.
